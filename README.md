 - **Inspiration.** This cheatsheet was inspired by the course contents of the [Git Complete: The definitive, step-by-step guide to Git Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-complete/) by [Jason Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasongtaylor/). I've gone into further details about selected topics and included broader version control concepts.
